This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(diamonds)
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=price), data=subset(diamonds, !is.na(price))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(300, 19000, 10), limits = c(300, 19000)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1400, 1600))

```
